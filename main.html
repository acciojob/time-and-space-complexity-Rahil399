	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time, space, and effiecent are key pillars across various disciplines. Time tracks the progression of events, space defines the framework of existence, and complexity delves into the intricate nature of systems and problems. These concepts underpin our understanding of the universe, from the smallest particles to the vast expanse of galaxies, and shape how we perceive and analyze phenomena in our world.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity and O(n) are integral concepts in computer science, particularly in algorithm analysis. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input. In other words, if the input size doubles, the space required by the algorithm also doubles. This linear relationship is crucial for understanding the efficiency and scalability of algorithms, as it allows us to predict how much memory will be needed as the problem size increases. By optimizing algorithms to achieve better space complexity, we can conserve memory resources and improve overall performance, making them more practical for real-world applications.</b></p>
