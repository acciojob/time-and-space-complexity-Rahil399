	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	 <p>Time complexity is an important concept in computer science. It refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, based on the length of the input. It is usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the time complexity in the worst case scenario. The lesser the time complexity, the faster the algorithm runs, making it more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> and O(n) are integral concepts in computer science, particularly in algorithm analysis. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input. In other words, if the input size doubles, the space required by the algorithm also doubles. This linear relationship is crucial for understanding the efficiency and scalability of algorithms, as it allows us to predict how much memory will be needed as the problem size increases. By optimizing algorithms to achieve better space complexity, we can conserve memory resources and improve overall performance, making them more practical for real-world applications.</p>
